# Query the connected input methods: `swaymsg -t get_inputs | grep Wacom`
# DOCS: To map wacom to the active screen do it in keybinds like:
#       bindsym $mod+1 workspace $ws1 ; exec $map-to-active
#       If you have that code on keybinds, just choose screen to enable it

# TODO: Needs to be re-implemented for hyprland
# $map-to-active = swaymsg input type:tablet_tool map_to_output `swaymsg -t get_outputs | jq -r '.[] | select(.focused == true) | .name'`
